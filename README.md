# Hangman-Game

This project creates a webpage on which a user can play hangman. The page randomly picks a word from a list and then begins accepting input via the keyboard. The user can press letters, which will then be checked against the letters in the word. If the letter is in the word, it will be displayed in its position(s) in the word. Otherwise, one guess will be subtracted from the total number of guesses. In either case, the letter will be added to the list of letters guessed, and cannot be entered again. If the user guesses the complete word or runs out of guesses, the game will restart with a new word, incrementing the win counter if necessary.
